# YOLO11-FineTune-Pothole-detection

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook to fine-tune a YOLO11-based detector for pothole detection. Dataset details, requirements and steps to run are documented in the notebook. 
We train YOLOv11s and YOLOv11m on a custom pothole detection dataset.

- The four training experiments are:
  - Fine tuning YOLOv7 with fixed resolution images.
  - Fine tuning YOLOv7 with multi-resolution images.
  - Fine tuning YOLOv7-Tiny with fixed resolution images.
  - Fine tuning YOLOv7-Tiny with multi-resolution images.
