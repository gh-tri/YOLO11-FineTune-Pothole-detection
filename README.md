# YOLO11-FineTune-Pothole-detection

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook to fine-tune a YOLO11-based detector for pothole detection. Dataset details, requirements and steps to run are documented in the notebook. 
We train YOLOv11s and YOLOv11m on a custom pothole detection dataset.

The four training experiments are:

Fine tuning YOLOv11s with fixed resolution images.
Fine tuning YOLOv11s with multi-resolution images.
Fine tuning YOLOv11m with fixed resolution images.
Fine tuning YOLOv11m with multi-resolution images.
